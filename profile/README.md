## Hey there!

We are a research team at [BioMed X GmbH](https://bio.mx/) in Heidelberg, Germany. Our goal is to develop a versatile computational platform that can predict the efficacy of first- or best-in-class drug candidates in virtual patient populations at an unprecedented accuracy, thereby addressing one of the most critical bottlenecks of the pharmaceutical industry today: a 90% failure rate of new drug candidates during clinical development.

In partnership with [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.de/), we will develop innovative artificial intelligence methods to build the virtual patient platform.

If this excites you, feel free to reach out to us for potential collaborations and discussions!
